### Project 3 - Behavioral Cloning

This is the third project of the sdc course. The goal of this project is to teach a convolutional net driving a car, at least driving a
car in a simulator.

#### Solution Design
The README thoroughly discusses the approach taken for deriving and designing a model architecture fit for solving the given problem.
- Starting basis: [Nvidia's model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/)

#### Model Architecture
The README provides sufficient details of the characteristics and qualities of the architecture, such as the type of model used, 
the number of layers, the size of each layer. Visualizations emphasizing particular qualities of the architecture are encouraged.

#### Training Set and Training Process
The README describes how the model was trained and what the characteristics of the dataset are. Information such as how the dataset 
was generated and examples of images from the dataset should be included.
